  <div class="div2n3"><p class="aha"> What is your long term goal or career pathway?

  </p>
  My career pathway will begin is getting a role in the tech industry, 
  possibly in a testing to start with and as I get a feel of the pathways 
  that open up I would like to explore my options. As and when my options expand 
  I would be highly interested in a role where I can motivate, support and lead a 
  high functioning team. As I gain more experience I will explore roles with international 
  companies so I could combine my love of travel or live in another country.

<div class="div2n3">
  <p class="aha">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</p>
  My strengths would be that I am organised, tenacious, usually keeping to deadline. 
  I tend to stay with a problem until I can figure it out which I am working on to dispel so
  I can keep within time box guidelines. I am confident that I am capable and I will reach my
  own goals but I am impatient and can be hard on myself for not grasping information quickly enough. 
  I thrive in team environment and fear that I may overlook important concepts because it 
  may be difficult to wrap my head around.

<div class="div2n3">

  <p class="aha">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed 
  in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
  Patience and grace with myself!

</div>
<div class="div2n3">
  <p class="aha">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
  This should include:</b>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
   and safely with other learners, 
  Facilitators and industry/community representatives
  </p>
  Firstly I will dedicate time to be available for productivity
  to take place and have time frames allocated for tasks.
  If issues arise I would communicate with those involved.

  </div>
<div class="div2n3"> 
  <p class="aha">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
  </p>

  </br>I would reach out to the facilitators if  things were building up and
  I was finding the course work difficult. I generally find exercise and meditation 
  are my staple for resetting my thought and shining new light. I find my friends nourish me with food and laughter.

  </div>
<div class="div2n3">
  <p class="aha">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
  </p>
  </br>Google, youtube, sifting thought Dev academy notes if I recall seeing 
  information and the amazing facilitators who I have found have broken information 
  down to the most basic level to help me work through concepts.

 </div>

 <div class="div2n3">
  <p class="aha">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
  </p>
  </br>Patience, insight and the ability to point me in the right direction.

  </div>

  <div class="div2n3">

  <p class="aha">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you 
  
  are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments 
  like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
  </p>
  </br>I will be doing school drop off and pickups during foundation and  
  school drops offs only during bootcamp. I will be travelling to US for a 
  family reunion on July 18th-21st. Currently looking at flying around at the 
  end of week 1 of careers week. I will try my best to be online for weeks 2.

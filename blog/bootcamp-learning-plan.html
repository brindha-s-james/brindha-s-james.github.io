<h1>Boot Camp Learning Plan</h1>
</div>  
<div class="div2n3 ">
    <p>
    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <br> I would like to use the skills gained during this course in the financial industry. I am also open to new interest that I may acquire along the way. I have my eyes set on a company that hire developers, nurture and train them. This would be the shortest of long term goals. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <br>I think my biggest strengths are that I am organised and usually on top of tasks. This has been challenged recently as I am learning something new,  I have felt my limitations of being hard on myself, getting frustrated, I could sit for hours with a problem even if I’m not progressing. This on reflection could have been lessened with regular breaks. I need to take regular breaks! 
    </p>
    <p> <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3> 
      <br>I think my biggest challenge would be family dynamics. I have put things in place to reduce the impact of these as much as possible. My second biggest non-technical challenge would be speaking in front of a group and wondering if I am making sense. <br> I have the mindset that I can survive bootcamp for 9 weeks as it is a tiny fraction of the 2 years that I have been waiting to do this course. My only option is survival and little voice that tells me why I am here.
    </p>

    <p> <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3> 
      <br>I would like to work on eloquently and coherently (or close to) explaining things without using filler words. I would like to be better at listening and looping. <br>I am keen on developing leadership skills and refining my reflective skills.
    </p>
    <p> <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3> 
      <br>I would like Bootcamp  team to review my work and provide constructive feedback on how I can work more efficiently and code clearly/cleanly.
    </p>
    <p> <h3> What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp </h3> 
      <br>I think it’s important to seek help in a timely manner because of the pace of bootcamp.  My plan is to review material from the day for a period of time, possibly for  half an hour once I get home and had dinner then work on assignments for a few hours of the evening. I will explore on google, YouTube and reach out to Bootcamp staff to stay productive and communicate with members involved as and when needed. 
      <br>I also plan to sleep for 7 hours and excercie in the mornings.

  <div class="div-1"> <h1>Foundation Learning Plan </h1>
  </div>
  <div class="div2n3"><p class="aha"> What is your long term goal or career pathway?

  </p>
  My career pathway will begin is getting a role in the tech industry, 
  possibly in a testing to start with and as I get a feel of the pathways 
  that open up I would like to explore my options. As and when my options expand 
  I would be highly interested in a role where I can motivate, support and lead a 
  high functioning team. As I gain more experience I will explore roles with international 
  companies so I could combine my love of travel or live in another country.
 


  <p class="aha">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</p>
  My strengths would be that I am organised, tenacious, usually keeping to deadline. 
  I tend to stay with a problem until I can figure it out which I am working on to dispel so
  I can keep within time box guidelines. I am confident that I am capable and I will reach my
  own goals but I am impatient and can be hard on myself for not grasping information quickly enough. 
  I thrive in team environment and fear that I may overlook important concepts because it 
  may be difficult to wrap my head around. 




  <p class="aha">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed 
  in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
  Patience and grace with myself!



  <p class="aha">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
  This should include:</b>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
   and safely with other learners, 
  Facilitators and industry/community representatives
  </p>
  Firstly I will dedicate time to be available for productivity
  to take place and have time frames allocated for tasks.
  If issues arise I would communicate with those involved.

 
  <p class="aha">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
  </p>

  </br>I would reach out to the facilitators if  things were building up and
  I was finding the course work difficult. I generally find exercise and meditation 
  are my staple for resetting my thought and shining new light. I find my friends nourish me with food and laughter.


  <p class="aha">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
  </p>
  </br>Google, youtube, sifting thought Dev academy notes if I recall seeing 
  information and the amazing facilitators who I have found have broken information 
  down to the most basic level to help me work through concepts.

 
  <p class="aha">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
  </p>
  </br>Patience, insight and the ability to point me in the right direction.

  

  <p class="aha">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you 
  
  are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments 
  like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
  </p>
  </br>I will be doing school drop off and pickups during foundation and  
  school drops offs only during bootcamp. I will be travelling to US for a 
  family reunion on July 18th-21st. Currently looking at flying around at the 
  end of week 1 of careers week. I will try my best to be online for weeks 2.

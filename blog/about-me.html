    <p>Hi, I’m Brindha. Welcome to my blog. </p>
    <p>I live in Wellington with my husband, 2 kids and a dog. </p>
    <p>I’ve been a pharmacist for the past 24 years. A fantastic fulfilling career that has seen me spend a decade working in the UK and supported plenty of travels. </p>
    <p> Over the last few years seeing my children growing up too fast had me yearning for more, to strike a balance, search for flexibility, 
        to work from anywhere and career progression. </b>It had been a journey figuring out what I wanted to do.
        There were many career pathways I could’ve pursued using my life and work experience that tickled my feather but a career in tech though foreign 
        (I remeber mcIntosh from school) ticked all the items on my wish list. 
    <p>The seed was planted and I started researching how life would be as a ‘techy’. This led me to Dev academy.</p>
    <p> My favourite quotes are: </br> 
       "The great secret of getting what you want from life is to know what you want 
       and believe you can have it"  and
        “a dream doesn’t become reality through magic. It takes sweat, determination and hard work”</p>
    <p>My favourite food is: food shared with loved ones.</p>
          
    <p>Thanks for reading!!</p>

Hi, I’m Brindha. Welcome to my blog. </p>
<p>
        I live in Wellington with my husband, 2 kids and a dog.  
        I’ve been a pharmacist for the past 24 years. A fantastic fulfilling career that has seen me spend a decade working in the UK and supported plenty of travels. 
        
        Seeing my children growing up too fast had me yearning for more, to strike a balance, search for flexibility, 
        to work from anywhere and career progression. 
        It had taken me many years to figure out what I wanted to do.
        There were many career pathways I could’ve pursued using my life and work experience that tickled my feather but a career in tech though foreign, ticked all the items on my wish list. The seed was planted and I started researching how life would be as a ‘techy’.
        
        My favourite quote is “ the great secret of getting what you want form life is to know what you want and believe you can have it.” 
        I’ve worked that part out so now I’m onto “a dream doesn’t become reality through magic. It takes sweat, determination and hard work”

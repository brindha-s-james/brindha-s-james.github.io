        <h3>When I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>
      <p>I felt there were numerous times where I was stuck on simple problems, starting with <i>Manipulating Objects module </i> in Javascript Kata.   
      <br> I had seen may people mentioning the case on Discord and assumed that I would find it difficult too. My mindset was that I needed to dig further to answer the questions. I wanted to check if I was thinking in the right direction but I did not want to be wrong on something that looked simple so I spent a lot of time researching for alternative ways.
    
       <br>I took time out and came back to it with the thought may be, I  did have the correct answer and when I finally checked the        answers, I was right. I learnt not to overthink somethings.

        <h3>When I problem solved elegantly</h3>
      <p>
        There has not been a time that I have problem solved elegantly. I look forward to achieving this in the future.

        <h3>Reflection on how confident I feel using the following problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>

        <p><b> Pseudocode </b>
        I think pseudocode is important in problem solving and feel comfortable using this.
        </p> 
        <p><b>Trying something</b>
         I don't feel confident enough in trying somethings yet, I have not been able to use console.log in VS code. 
        </p> 
        <p><b>Rubber ducky method</b>
         I'm getting better at this but still at the very early stages of this method, I tend to discuss things in my head a lot.
        </p> 
        <p><b>Reading error messages</b>
         I can read simple error messages.
        </p> 


        <p><b>Console.logging</b>
          I am not confident at all at at this, I have not used it in VS code and have not had success trying to figure it out.
        </p> 
        <p><b>Googling</b>
         I feel confident searching on google. 
        </p> 
        <p><b>Asking your peers for help</b>
        I find that my method of problem solving is through discussions. I feel comfortable asking for help.
        <p><b>Asking coaches for help</b>
         I do ask coaches for help but find that I don't always know how to ask the questions.
        </p> 
        <p><b>Improving your process with reflection</b>
         I am aware that I am behind and feelthere is a lot of information and my level of reflection could improve once I feel more confident.
        </p>

        <h3>The time I was reluctant to ask for help </h3>
        <p>There has been times I was reluctant to ask questions because I felt that I would not understand at that stage the reply I would have received.

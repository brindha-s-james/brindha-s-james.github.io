  Emotional intelligence is the ability to read the emotional environment 
  within and around us, this is the feelings and emotions. 
  For example, if we feel upset, by
  noticing that we are experiencing this feeling, we can control how we react
  rather than unconsciously reacting. This uncouncsious reaction can negatively
  affect the environement around us and disturb our inner calm. By noticing our emotion 
  and feelings, we are making a <b>choice</b> in how to deal with this emotion. 
  It is what some would say “street smart”.
</p>

<p>
  How is this different from IQ? Well, IQ is a measure of academic ability, 
  to analyse information and use logic, remember, recall and apply information
  or what is called “book smart".
</p>
<p>
  We live in a place where change is constant and complex. 
  <br> IQ matters in helping navigate this ever changing place
  but not as much as EQ.
 <br> Having the ability to regulate ourselves and read the emotions of
  others will lead to better relationships. It is am important factor in good leadership and 
  personal performance and team performance and overall happiness.
  <br>Understanding the emotions within our selves and others around us and guiding our actions 
  accordingly,<b> WE ARE IN CONTROL</b>. 
</p>
  
<p>Luckily, this valuable skill can be learnt.

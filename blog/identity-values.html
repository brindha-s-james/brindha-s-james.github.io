    <p class="aha">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed
       up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </p>
    <p>About 4 years ago, I had the opportunity to start up a medical centre.  
      </br>I was excited at the challenge, the unknown, all falling into place.
      My business partner and I had found Gps to join the centre who would eventually become partners and take over 
      the shares of my co-founder, lets call him “Mike”. The majority shares would be held by us and the GP’s 
      will initially have a smaller share and a pretty good guranteed income
      considering this was a start up. 
      
    </p>
    <p>
    The day came for us and the 2 GP’s to meet with the lawyers to sign
     the legal documents to go ahead. GP’s had decided to communicate in
     the presence of their lawyer that Mike does not provide any value 
     and they should have his share. This blindsided Mike, who recently 
     had a concussion. He found this rejection nauseating.  
  </br>I stated the case for how the 2 GP’s 
      had even gotten to the current position and how this venture is 
      what Mike and I had set up. </br>I questioned their future 
      trustworthiness if this is the beginning of this relationship.
    </br> I stood up for my co-founder. 
</p>
<p>We did not make head way with legal documents. 
</br>I went away on holiday for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>On my return, a meeting was arranged. 
</br>I walked into the meeting room and saw the GP’s were seated next
to Mike. <span id="aha">He was back in the game. </span>
 The GP’s claimed that I had been difficult and Mike agreed. 
 
 <span class="thought">I had been the one to come up wtih the  business plan, 
  build the idea from scratch, negotiated DHB contracts, 
  organised marketing, hired the GP’s, nurses, practice manager.</span> 
 </br>They wanted to pay me to leave. I stood up for Mike . I felt hurt. I left.
</p>
<p>
  Reflecting on this, the ambitious me regrets not playing the game but the values that I stand for supports my decision. I would in the future if I was co-founding, ensure that legal agreement exists before any work was done. I trusted that I wouldn’t be taken advantage of. I still trust and vouch not to change that part of me.
   I have a learnt a lot to have the courage to embark on big projects that I may be out of depth with in the future, I feel life is all about asking the right people the right questions and keeping an open mind.

  <p class="aha">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
  </p>
<p>I have been brought of in a culture of high expectations. I always rebelled and wanted to be me. I was clear of it and took my own path when I was younger but I did this safely so that I would not upset my parents too much. My family matters greatly. I also have friends that are similar and some that definitely had taken the safe route. My thinking changed a lot from the time I had met my husband. He is strong in what he sees as right and wrong, he is unapologetically himself. I part admired this and part wished he would pander a little to his environment. I took this as my que to start a journey into who I want to be with the values I already possess. I chose to speak very openly about the person I want to be for my own family and kids along with the values I admired and also disliked. This shaping is in progress today as I take a stance on loving strongly and discussing any conflicts and insecurities that arise with my family/kids and friends.

<p class="aha">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
</p>
<p>I used to  be a fly off the seat of my pants kind of person. I learn enough to do enough. Having children and diving deep into martial arts I decided to flip mode, I give everything I do, the best of me. I look after myself physically and mentally so I am always in the right state of mind for what ever that </br> I seem to get difficult scenarios dished out to me. This has given me ample practice to be resilient, persistent, consistent, calm, reflective in my  approach which i think will support my learning journey.

<p class="aha">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
</p>
<p>I am building from ground up on this learning journey which I am completely at rest with. I know my core will be strong as I had built up myself through tricky personal relationships and plenty of self reflection.

<div class="div2n3">
<p class="aha"> Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
</p>
<p>
  I had been in positions of seniority in my career and have  been successful in working collaboratively. In personal relationships I had come across tension. I can not recall a particular example but resistance and tension absolutely leaves me frustrated but I have noticed that I don’t let this show which may contribute to the other person taking a more bull headed stance. I would ask for a time and out and a revisit of the tense topic later in the day and then talk about it when things would cool down. Usually there will be a headway hence I would stick to this strategy and re evaluate in the future if need be. I find I adapt easily and do not shy away from sitting back and thinking of alternative strategies.

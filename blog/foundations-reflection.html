      </h3>
    
     <b> The 3 new things that I have learnt about myself:</b>
    <br>I can be hard on myself when I set goals, I need to learn to be kinder to myself.
    <br>I have a fear of failing not from being a perfectionist but from not achieving my greater goals and the flow on affect of those.
    I've always embraced the concept of neuroplasty but to see it in action, the slow procecess of it has been hard, I need to be more patient.
    <br>I need to take more deep breaths!

    <br> Self-awareness is curiousity that leads to establishment of values and empathy, being comfortable with own feeling and emotions opens the door to  being aware of strengths and weaknesses.

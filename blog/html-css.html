    <h1> What are the best practices associated with using classes vs ids? </h1>

<p>In this tech blog I will talk about 2 CSS attributes that can be used to style a web page and best practice associated with using these. The attributes are classes and ids.
</p>
<p> When considering if class or id attribute should be used, the question to ask is: "is there more than one element that requires the same style? If the answer is 
    yes, then class attribute is best applied. Class attribute is used to apply styles to multiple elements. Id attribute is used to apply styles to only one element. </p>

    <p>  We will look at examples of application of these styles to the background of elements. </p>
    <p>Example 1- Class attribute:
    </br> We have 3 sections and 3 heading on our web page. 
     We would like all 3 sections and 1 heading to have the same background.
        We would apply the styles using the class attribute. Class is referenced by putting a <span class="bold">.</span> in front of the name. </br>
CSS declarataion would look like this:<br>  <img src="../Images/class .png" alt="class"><br>
HTML reference will look like this: </br>  <img src="../Images/class tag.png" alt="class-tag"></br>
</p>
<p>Example 2- Id attribute. 
</br>We have 3 heading on our web page and we would like different styling to 2 of the headings. 
    We would apply the id attribute. Id is referenced by putting a <span class="bold">#</span> in front of the name.
</br>CSS declaration would look like this: </br><img src="../Images/Id .png" alt="Id"> 
</br>HTML reference will look like this: </br> <img src="../Images/Id tag.png" alt="Id-tag">.

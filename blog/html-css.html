    <h1> What are the best practices associated with using classes vs ids? </h1>

<p>In this tech blog I will talk about 2 CSS attributes that can be used to style a web page and best practice associated with using these. The atributes are Class's and Id's.
</p>
<p> When considering if Class or Id attribute should be used, the question to ask is: "is there more than one element that requires the same style? If the answer is 
    yes, then Class attribute is best applied. Id attribute is used to apply styles to only one element. </p>

    <p>  We will look at examples of application of these styles to the background of elements. </p>
    <p>Example 1:
        <p>We have 3 sections to our web page separated by <img src="" alt="">(div photo) and we want all the sections to have the same background.
        We would apply the styles using the class attribute. Clss'ss are referenced by putting a . in front of the name.
Our CSS declartaion would look like this:  <img src="" alt="commandline screenshot 1">
</p>
<p>Example 2. We have 3 heading and we would like unique styling to 2 of the heading and the same style as the section to 1 of the headings. 
    We would apply the id attribute. Id's are referenced by putting a # in front of the name.
     Our CSS declaration would look like this: <img src="" alt="commandline screenshot 2"> 

    </p>

  <h1>Sprint 3 Tech </h1>  
  <h2><b>An analogy to describe JavaScript and 
    its relationship to HTML and CSS.</b></h2>
    <p>
Imagine HTML as the human body, now it pretty much looks the same most of the time.
 Now add in CSS to give it style just like we would put a nice top, pants, nice shoes, you can change 
 this around each day, even each hour depending on how you want to look. 
 Now we're looking good but we're not moving yet. This is where Javascript comes in 
 to add fun and make it more life like! 

    </p>
  <h2><b>Explain control flow and loops using an 
    example process from everyday life, for example,
     'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' 
     (but not those).</b></h2>
  <p>CONTROL fLOW is how a computer does what it is told 
    to do, it is the order of doing things. It is similar to say going to the gym. Once you decided that you're going to the gym,
    you change into your clothes, then pop your shoes on, you grab your keys, get in the car then you drive to the gym.
    Now that's pretty smooth because we don't actually need to repeat anything there. 
    Now once you get to the gym, you run on the treadmill then you decide to lift weights.
    This is where we are going to repeat ourselves as we do sets. We'll do 3 sets of 10 of our chosen weight.
    This is when the loop comes in, we start with 0 sets, do 10 lifts then move up to the second set of ten then third set of ten. 
    Rather than repeating the instruction each time, we can give the instructions
    via a code so that it is repeated for us until 3 sets are done.
    Once the conditions are met, we move on with the rest of the day or in programming the rest of the code.

  <h2><b>Describe what the DOM is and an example 
    of how you might interact with it </b></h2>
    <p>
      The DOM is is an acronym for Document Object Model. It is an API (application programming interface)
      The document is the webpage which is basically HTML. Every element in the HTML document is an object in the DOM.
      The model is how the objects are laid out in a tree form.
      We can use the DOM when we interact with webpages. By interacting with the DOM can change the text, 
      background color....
      
      To make HTML document more interactive, 
      javascrpt needs to access the contents of the document and know when the
       user is interacting with it.

     <h2><b> Explain the difference between 
      accessing data from arrays and objects. </b></h2>
      <p>Objects and Arrays are a container for data. Objects is used for storing items with their properties
        and arrays is used for storing itmes in order.
        
        key thing about objects is they feature a key:value pair
        system. A key is the name of the item in the container and it given a value. 
        It is expressed as key:value;
        Here is an example 
        let car ={
          make: 'Toyota',
          model: 'Yaris',
          year: 2013
        }
        To access the data out of objects, you would express it like this:
        car.make 
        which will give you the make Toyota

        ARRAYS. Unlike Objects, arrays are a list that is in order. 
        Arrays are ordered in square brackets.
        For example
        let cars = ['Toyota', 'Nissan', 'Suzuki', 'Mazda']
        We get information out of arrays by using index position
        of items inside the array. Items are counted from Zero in an array.
        ie- toyota's index position is 0
       
      </p>

      <h2><b>  Explain what functions 
        are and why they are helpful.</b></h2>
        <p>
          Functions in Javascript so we don't need to repeat the same instructions for doing something, saving a lot of time. in programming language, they 
          are reusable blocks of code.
